Introduction</h1>
<p>An easy-to-use interface to the <b>NXP Sensor Fusion version 7</b> algorithms.</p>
<p>It is configured to work with the Adafruit breakout board #3643 using the <em>NXP FXOS8700</em> magnetometer/accelerometer and <em>FXAS21002</em> gyroscope sensor ICs, but can be modified to work with other sensors having an I2C interface. With additional modification, it can also work with SPI interface sensors.</p>
<p>The library runs on Espressif's ESP32 and ESP8266 processors and outputs orientation data using the serial and WiFi interfaces.</p>
<p>A C++ class provides simple access to the most common sensor fusion functions, but it is also possible to directly interface with the library methods contained in the underlying C files, which are based on those provided by NXP in their version 7.20 release.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
Background</h1>
<p>Orientation sensing using multi-mode sensors (e.g. accelerometer + gyroscope + magnetometer) has become quite accurate when coupled with the right sensor fusion software. My motivation for porting NXP's library is to create an orientation sensor for marine use, using off-the-shelf hardware and the Signal K / SensESP project (<a href="https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP">https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP</a>) to provide orientation data (e.g. magnetic heading, roll, and pitch) on a vessel.</p>
<p>An earlier version of NXP's sensor fusion library has been ported by AdaFruit for use with their sensors in the Arduino environment. A newer version of the NXP sensor fusion library (version 7.2) is available, which is what this present project is using. This newer library has several improvements, including the ability to perform magnetic calibration while in use (as opposed to needing a separate software tool).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Sensor</h1>
<p>The present software works with the NXP 9DOF sensor combination (magnetometer, accelerometer, gyroscope) consisting of <b>FXOS8700 + FXAS21002</b> (e.g. <em>Adafruit #3463 breakout</em> board). Only the I2C interface has been implemented and tested; a SPI interface is possible with additional work and testing.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
Dependencies</h1>
<p>The fusion code and associated project files have been written for and tested in the <em>PlatformIO</em> development environment, as an <em>Arduino</em> framework project for an ESP32 board.</p>
<p>This project uses the <b>Wire (I2C)</b> library. <br  />
 If WiFi output is enabled then it also requires the <b>WiFi</b> libraries.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
How-To Use</h1>
<p>To use this library follow these steps (some untested - let me know of any changes you needed to make to get things to work on your setup):</p><ul>
<li>setup the PlatformIO development environment</li>
<li>create a new PlatformIO project, selecting the <em>Board:</em> <code>Espressif ESP-WROVER-KIT</code> and <em>Framework:</em> <code>Arduino</code> (other ESP32 boards should work without changes; other Espressif CPUs like the ESP8266 may need some code adjustments - not tested)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now follow either of these two methods to bring in the library files: </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Method 1</h2>
<ul>
<li>create a local clone of this repository on your computer</li>
<li>from your local repository, copy <code>/examples/fusion_text_output.cc</code> into your new PlatformIO project's <code>/src</code> folder. You may want to rename it <code>main.cc</code> to remind yourself that it contains the <code>setup()</code> and <code>loop()</code> functions.</li>
<li>from your local repository, copy the files and subfolders of <code>/src/*</code> into your new project's <code>/lib/sensor_fusion</code> folder</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
Method 2</h2>
<ul>
<li>copy this project's <code>/examples/fusion_text_output.cc</code> into your new PlatformIO project's <code>/src</code> folder</li>
<li>in your new project's <code>platformio.ini</code> file, add the SensorFusionLibrary <b>TODO fixup</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Then: <br  />
</p><ul>
<li>edit your new project's <code>platformio.ini</code> file for your specific board and environment. Use this project's <code>platformio.ini</code> file as an example.</li>
<li>edit <code>/lib/sensor_fusion/board.h</code> to reflect your particular hardware. The I2C pins connecting your processor to your sensor ICs will likely be different, and you may also need to change the I2C addresses that the ICs are configured for.</li>
<li>compile and download to your processor</li>
</ul>
<p>The file<code>/lib/sensor_fusion/build.h</code> contains defines for various functionality, such as whether the software outputs its data via hardware serial UART or WiFi TCP connections, or both (default). Edit this file as desired, but note that not all combinations of features may be valid or been tested.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
NXP Sensor Toolbox</h2>
<p>The out-of-the-box software is configured to send data packets containing the sensor fusion results at a rate of 40 Hz over the processor's Serial UART interface (connected to the USB port on my WROVER development kit). These packets are formatted for NXP's <b>Sensor Fusion Toolbox</b> Windows application (available for download from NXP at no cost) which will display the data and can even be used to send commands back to the processor running the fusion algorithms. See the User's Guide under the Help tab of the Toolbox for details.</p>
<p>The <b>Toolbox</b> when working should show a graphic of a PCB that rotates on the screen in synchronization with motion of your own board. If there is no motion at all, then check that the data packets are arriving on the expected COM: port of your computer. A terminal program (like HyperTerminal or PuTTY) can help display traffic on a COM: port. If the <b>Toolbox</b> shows motion but it is jerky or reversed from the actual board motion, then likely one or more of your board's axes are not oriented according to how the fusion software expects. Different sensor board manufacturers will have placed the sensor ICs in orientations particular to their own needs. The file <code><a class="el" href="hal__axis__remap_8c.html" title="Hardware Abstraction layer for the particular sensors used. Depending on the design of the sensor PCB...">hal_axis_remap.c</a></code> is used to invert or swap axes as needed to conform to what the fusion algorithm expects. For more details, see that file, and also NXP's Application Note AN5017 (Coordinate Systems).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
WiFi Data Streaming</h2>
<p>Because testing an orientation sensor with a USB cable tethering it to your development computer is a pain, the software also supports streaming the data over WiFi. In the main <code>setup()</code> code, a WiFi AP (Access Point) is started, which means the ESP processor will broadcast it's SSID and you should be able to connect to it with your development system, using the password you provide in the <code>main.cc</code> file. Once a WiFi connection is established, you can open a TCP connection to port 23 of the ESP and the orientation data will then stream over your TCP connection. A few hints:</p><ul>
<li>view the ESP's serial output (e.g. using that USB connection) to find out what IP address the ESP has assigned itself</li>
<li>on a linux system, an easy way to make and test the connection is the command <code>telnet 192.168.4.1</code>, where you replace the example IP address with the one the ESP has indicated in it's serial output.</li>
<li>Once you have noted the IP address, it shouldn't change between reboots of the ESP.</li>
<li>piping the data from the TCP connection to a serial port on a Windows computer (to make it available for the Sensor Toolbox) isn't trivial, unfortunately. I tried two applications: <b>H.W. Virtual Serial Port</b> and <b>TCP-COM</b>. Both are free for time-limited trial copies. The first one exhibited intermittent data dropouts, which confused the Sensor Toolbox quite badly. TCP-COM was better-behaved and has worked well for several hours. There may be better alternatives - if you know of one, let me know and I'll list it here.</li>
</ul>
<p>I did earlier try having the ESP connect as a client to our WiFi router, rather than acting as an AP itself. Unfortunately, this caused delays in delivery of the streamed traffic that would intermittently freeze the Sensor Toolbox (another symptom was performing a <code>ping</code> from the development computer to the ESP - trip times sometimes exceeded 1000 ms when going through the router). So, using the ESP as an AP was better for the timeliness of data delivery, on my hardware.</p>
<p>Using WiFi (even when ESP is acting as AP) <em>does</em> introduce noticeable lag in the Toolbox graphic response, compared to when wired via USB. It looks like about a 200 ms lag on my system.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
Additional Debugging</h2>
<p>You can use the GPIO output that toggles each time through the data collection and sending loop to confirm whether your ESP is collecting and transmitting data regularly. Using the default software, the output should toggle every 25 ms (i.e. a 20 Hz square wave). See <code>fusion_text_output.cc</code> for details.</p>
