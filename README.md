# OrientationSensorTesting
Contains test plans, results, to-do lists relating to testing of an orientation sensor.

## Sensor
NXP 9DOF sensor combination (magnetometer, accelerometer, gyroscope) consisting of FXOS8700 + FXAS21002 (e.g. Adafruit #3463 breakout board).

## Background
The sensor is used with the Signal K / SensESP project (https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP) to provide orientation data (e.g. magnetic heading, roll, and pitch) on a vessel.
The aim of the testing is to determine characteristics of the sensor such as accuracy, repeatability, and response time.

## Where To Find...
- test plans, data, results, etc are on [this project's Wiki](https://github.com/BjarneBitscrambler/OrientationSensorTesting/wiki)
- code specific for this testing is under this project's Code tab
- code for general operation of the sensor is on the [Upstream](https://github.com/SignalK/SensESP) and [author's](https://github.com/BjarneBitscrambler/SensESP) project pages
